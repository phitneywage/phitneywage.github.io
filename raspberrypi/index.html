<h3>In the beginning...</h3>
	<p>While spinning on my spin bike one afternoon, I started to wonder how effeient my exercise regimen really was. How many RPM's? How quickly is my heart rate climbing and dropping and how can I keep it in the fat burning zone?</p>

	<h3>So Now What?</h3>
	<p>As an avid tinkering soul, I stared building my own heartrate monitor for my basic spin bike. As this led to more ideas and projects, my excitement grew. I might not be the only one interested in this data.</p>
