	<h3>What is Pi?</h3>
	<p>Can I eat the raspberry pi? Unfortunately no. This pi is a low cost, credit card sized computer that can be transformed into a variety of electronic projects.</p>
	<br>
	<h3>In the beginning...</h3>
	<p>While riding my spin bike one day, I got rather frustrated that I couldn't get an accurate bpm reading. I wanted to stay in the fat burning zone and really make the most of my workout. This is where my first project stemmed from. I now have a heart rate monitor to help track how quickly my heart rate is rising and dropping, thus making my workouts more efficent.</p>
	<p>A tinkering soul at heart, my excitment grew. You can create almost anything you can think of. You can enhance your lifestyle or simply build games to entertain. The projects are essentially limitless.</p>
